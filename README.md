# 3-bit-CPU-Design
I have designed a 3-bit CPU in Multisim. I have started by designing a 3-bit ALU, a 3-bit register set, a 3-bit counter register, and a 3-bit program counter (PC) adder. The CPU has had a word size of 16 bits, so a 16-bit SRAM has been required. The CPU has supported arithmetic and logic instructions in two modes: Register Mode and Immediate Mode. The ALU has supported shift left (SHL) and shift right (SHR) operations in all two modes. The CPU has supported JNC in Branching mode. The Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) has a size of 16 bits. The opcode for the ISA has been 3 bits, and the operand has been 13 bits. I have needed to design the ISA for SHL, SHR and JNC operations separately for each of the three modes.
