# 3-bit-CPU-Design
I have designed a 3-bit CPU in Multisim. I have started by designing a 3-bit ALU, a 3-bit register set, a 3-bit counter register, and a 3-bit program counter (PC) adder. The CPU has had a word size of 16 bits, so a 16-bit SRAM has been required. The CPU has supported arithmetic and logic instructions in three modes: Register Mode, Immediate Mode, and Branching Mode. The ALU has supported shift left (SHL) and shift right (SHR) operations in all three modes. Since the CPU has had a 16-bit word size, the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) has also been 16 bits. The opcode for the ISA has been 3 bits, and the operand has been 13 bits. I have needed to design the ISA for SHL and SHR operations separately for each of the three modes.
